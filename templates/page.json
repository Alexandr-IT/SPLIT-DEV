He was ashamed and disgusted by this wasteful consumption and inefficiency so he sought out world-renowned microbiologist, Dr Ronald Russell at Trinity College in Dublin, to help realize his vision of introducing a portable water purifier for everyday use and eliminate the need for single use plastic water bottles."

Within seconds, contaminants found in ordinary tap water are neutralized and the pH balance is optimized for healthy hydration. Unlike carbon water filters that only work once, PuriBloc technology works continuously through a natural process known as ionic exchange and keeps pure water fresh and great tasting for months."
